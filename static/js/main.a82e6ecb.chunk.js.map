pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and\r\n                                    equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which\r\n                                    is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are\r\n                                    perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice\r\n                                    is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,\r\n                                    every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.

The\r\n                                    wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he\r\n                                    rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to\r\n                                    avoid worse pains.</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n
